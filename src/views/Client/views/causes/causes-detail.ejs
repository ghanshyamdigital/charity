Being homeless is perhaps hardest on the children. They need to feel safe and secure, so that they can concentrate in school. In addition to this, they need exercise, recreation and playtime. You can donate to help African children to help them get their shelter. In short, homeless children need everything that we take for granted but they need it every day.
												</p>
												<p>
													You can offer any kind of support to homeless children by providing therapeutic support services with the goal of improving their emotional and behavioral well being. This helps the childrenâ€™s progression towards increased financial stability.
												</p>

												<p>
													Homeless children need a wide range of support services to address their mental and physical health. They often need addiction treatment, psychological counseling, job training, childcare and eventual job placement help. Providing an overall growth to homeless children is not an easy task and the job cannot be fulfilled without your support. Hence, help us raise the standards of these poverty stricken children in any of the manners possible. We attempt to provide shelter, security and a bright future to the children in the following manner. 
												</p>

												<ul class="list-trangled">
													<li>
														Fulfillment of primary necessities that includes food, clothing and shelter
													</li>
													<li>
														Medical care to the children who have a poor health or to those who require special medical attention
													</li>
													<li>
														Education opportunities to homeless children so that they can have a bright future ahead
													</li>
													<li>
														Security to their future by providing them training on sports and other curriculum activities
													</li>
												</ul>
